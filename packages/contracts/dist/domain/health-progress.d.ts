/**
 * @ai-context Health Progress domain contracts | shared enums and constants for health tracking
 *
 * This module provides the canonical definitions for health progress-related constants:
 * - Health trends (improving, stable, declining)
 * - Data quality levels (sufficient, sparse, insufficient)
 * - Health metric directions and categories
 * - HealthMetricKey type (string alias post-MetricDefinition migration)
 *
 * BUSINESS CONTEXT:
 * Hollis Health differentiates from standard gyms by tracking actual HEALTH OUTCOMES,
 * not just activity metrics. This enables:
 * - Demonstrating ROI to clients (is their A1C actually improving?)
 * - Identifying clients whose health is declining despite activity
 * - Providing data to referring physicians
 * - Justifying premium pricing through measurable outcomes
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * CRITICAL DATA INVARIANTS (Enforced by tests)
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * 1. METRIC-ONLY STORAGE:
 *    - Weight: ALWAYS stored in kg (never lbs)
 *    - Height: ALWAYS stored in cm (never inches/feet)
 *    - Temperature: ALWAYS stored in °C (never °F)
 *
 * 2. US LAB UNITS (not international SI):
 *    - Glucose: mg/dL (NOT mmol/L - would be 18x wrong!)
 *    - Testosterone: ng/dL (NOT nmol/L - would be 28x wrong!)
 *    - Cholesterol: mg/dL (NOT mmol/L)
 *    - HbA1c: % (NOT mmol/mol)
 *
 * 3. UNIT VALIDATION:
 *    - Data with mismatched units is REJECTED, not auto-converted
 *
 * CRITICAL: Mixing units could show false "improvement" when health is declining!
 *
 * IMPORTANT: All health trend and data quality enum values MUST be imported from here.
 *
 * NOTE: The static HEALTH_METRIC_DEFINITIONS registry was removed in Phase 6 of the
 * Unified MetricDefinition Migration. MetricDefinition records in the database are now
 * the authoritative source. HealthMetricKey is widened to string accordingly.
 *
